Meme Generator is a simple React application that generates meme images using an API and allows users to add custom text to create memes. This project utilizes React to create a user-friendly interface where users can interact with the application. It fetches meme images from an external API and provides an input field for users to enter custom text. Once the text is entered, users can generate the meme with the custom text overlayed on the image. This project demonstrates the use of React components, state management, and API integration to create a fun and interactive meme-generating experience.
